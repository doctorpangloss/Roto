1. Make sure you have qt, qt-devel installed.  

2. Download boost (boost.org), and change main.pro and KLT/main.pro to point to it (edit /homes/gws/aseem/boost to the correct location).

3. cd KLT; qmake main.pro; make
This will compile a library; hopefully it will produce libKLT.a

4. cd ..; qmake main.pro; make
Hopefully this will produce the program main

5. cd release
From here, refer to DOCS to try to run the included data sets
